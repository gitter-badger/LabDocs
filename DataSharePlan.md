Data and Resource Sharing Plan
================================

It is the philosophy of our group to make data available to the widest potential audience in a timely manner.


##Data Sharing 

###Routine Activity

Research activities will be recorded daily in online lab notebooks. Lab notebooks can be maintained in various platforms including Evernote, Wikispaces, IPython, and GitHub. Noteboooks will be made centrally accessible at genefish.wikispaces.com.   

###Product Publication

All published data will be submitted to journals indexed by the major biomedical indexing sites including PubMed and PubMed Central. In instances where a publisher version of a publication is not open access, an open access alternative (author's version) will be made available on the lab website (http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/?page_id=246). For all studies, the raw data, as well as the relevant metadata and computational algorithms used to generate statistical and graphical summaries which were used to generate the final research data will be provided. This data will be provided with a permissive (CC0 or CC-BY) use license.  Data will be deposited as supplementary data to the relevant publications where possible and where permitted, deposited to web-accessible data repositories such as Figshare (http://figshare.com) or similar services. Finally data will be posted on, or linked to, from the principal investigator’s website. If further data is obtained relevant to these studies, which can be combined with the published data sets, these evolving data sets will be added to the available online repositories, separately from the published data sets.

##Resource Sharing

All reagents or kits will be clearly described in publications, including catalog or stock numbers. This data will also be provided in the metadata associated with published data sets. Samples, plasmids, antibodies, and other products described in these studies will be maintained in the principal investigator’s laboratory and made available freely and without restriction to any scientists, providing sufficient amounts are available.
