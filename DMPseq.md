#Data Management Plan (Sequence Data)

Data Management Plan for dealing with sequencing data. 


##Sequence Job Submission
We send material to a variety of facilities. As the samples are shipped to a facility, respective information is entered in the Google Docs spreadsheet [*Next Gen Seq Library Database*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtV_gF766XZAdHRlUHJMd0k4S2RpdTZqbjFob2NJb2c&usp=sharing).
