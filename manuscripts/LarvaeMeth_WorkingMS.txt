Indication of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns in developing oysters


Abstract
The roles of DNA methylation during development remain enigmatic in numerous invertebrate species. This includes understanding whether DNA methylation is inherited and to what extent methylation varies during development. To identify individual variation, paternal transmission, and developmental patterns of DNA methylation, high-resolution methylome characterization of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae was performed. Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns are inherited, as methylation patterns are similar between males and their offspring among two lineages. To examine methylation differences between two oyster families, lineage-specific differentially methylated loci were identified and found throughout the genome. However when considered relative to location of CpG loci, these loci were found had relatively higher levels in predicted transposable elements. Similar results were found in comparing different developmental stages. We attribute the predominance of differentially methylated loci within transposable elements to be a result associated with our assumption that changes in methylation in genes and promoter regions are selected against as they might compromise survival.  Furthermore, differentially methylated loci in transposable elements could contribute to increased genome diversity. 










Introduction
DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is ubiquitous across many eukaryotes, with variable patterns and functions across taxa. This epigenetic mechanism involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosines, usually in a CpG dinucleotide context, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation can alter gene expression without modifying the underlying nucleotide sequence, and functions in mammals to suppress transcription through increased methylation in promoter regions (Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000).  In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for development and differentiation of organs and tissues (Okano et al. 1999). Likewise, mutations of DNA methyltransferase in mammals may result in developmental delays and mortality (Li et al. 1992). 
        In contrast to the densely methylated mammalian genomes, several invertebrate species display low to intermediate levels of methylation. In invertebrates, it has been proposed that DNA methylation of genes may be associated with alternative splicing events (i.e. honey bee (Lyko et al. 2010) and Nasonia (Park et al. 2011)). Methylation of gene bodies has also been shown to have a positive relationship with transcriptional activity in oysters (Gavery and Roberts, 2013; Olson and Roberts, 2014a). Currently there is an incomplete understanding of the regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation in invertebrates, though it appears to be distinct from mechanisms observed in mammals and likely varies across species. 
             From the limited studies that have focused on invertebrates, research has shown that similar to mammals, DNA methylation has important regulatory functions during early development. For example, research on the honey bee Apis mellifera found DNA methylation to be abundant in the genome, with methylation being associated with altered gene expression resulting in bee caste differentiation (Elango et al. 2009; Kucharski et al. 2008). Furthermore, DNA methylation has been shown to regulate gene expression during Octopus vulgaris development, particularly during the first paralarval stage that includes significant morphological changes (Diaz-Freije et al. 2014). The first indication that methylation was an important regulator of development in C. gigas was by Riviere et al. (2013), who found treatment with 5-Aza-cytidine leads to developmental alterations and abnormal phenotypes in oysters. 
        Despite the essential role of methylation in development, there is limited information on individual variation in DNA methylation patterns among invertebrates and particularly how any methylation information might be passed on to offspring.  Furthermore, we do not have a full understanding of ontogenetic changes in DNA methylation. In order to better understand to what degree DNA methylation patterns are heritable, variable between individuals, and changing during C. gigas development, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in gametes and larval oysters (72 and 120 hours post-fertilization) from two lineages. 




Methods
Experimental Design
Oysters (two males and a single female) were collected from Oakland Bay, South Puget Sound, WA. Oysters were strip spawned by scoring the gonad tissue with a sterile razor blade and rinsing out gametes with sterile seawater. Oocytes were incubated for 30 minutes in sterile seawater and 2 million oocytes each were placed into two separate plastic containers. Sperm diluted in sterile seawater (1L) from each male were used to fertilize oocytes. Fertilization was confirmed by examining polar bodies in cells under a compound microscope. 
Larvae were kept in static tanks (100L) up to 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf).  Counts of oyster larvae were performed at 120 hpf to confirm normal development. Two samples for DNA methylation analyses were taken from sperm prior to fertilization, and larvae samples collected at days 72 hpf and 120 hpf.  Larvae samples were taken by filtering on a 20µm screen. All samples were preserved in 95% ethanol. For simplicity the sperm and corresponding larvae samples are referred to as lineage #1 and lineage #3 based on paternity.


Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Genomic DNA was extracted using DNAzol according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). High molecular weight genomic DNA (6 ug per sample), was used to prepare six libraries for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Briefly, DNA was fragmented to an average length of 250 bp in an Adaptive Focused Acoustics (AFA) microtube using a Covaris S2 (Covaris Inc Woburn, MA) with the following settings: duty cycle 20%, intensity of 4.0, cycles per burst 200, for 60 seconds. Fragment size resulting from DNA shearing was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Libraries were constructed using the Paired-End DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with standard protocols. Unmethylated Lambda DNA (0.5%) (Promega Co. Madison, WI) was added to the each sample prior to fragmentation and library construction to serve as a measure of bisulfite conversion efficiency. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 72 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Library construction and sequencing was performed by the High Throughput Genomics Center (htSEQ, Seattle, WA).  
Bisulfite sequencing reads from the six libraries were quality filtered to remove adapter sequences and separately mapped to the Crassostrea gigas genome (version GCA_000297895.1; Zhang et al. 2012) using Bisulfite Sequencing Mapping Program BSMAP v2.74 (Xi and Li 2009). Resulting alignment from mapping bisulfite treated reads was analyzed with methratio, a Python script that accompanies BSMAP. Parameters for methratio included reporting loci with zero methylation ratios (-z), combining CpG methylation ratios on both strands (-g) and only using unique mappings (-u). Only CpG loci covered by at least 3 sequenced reads were considered for further analysis. Data can be accessed and computational analysis performed as described via a GitHub repository (Olson and Roberts, 2014b)[a]. The IPython notebook in this repository includes all steps necessary for downloading and reproducing the analyses of described in this manuscript.


Global DNA Methylation Comparison
Whole-genome DNA methylation correlation and clustering were performed using the program methylKit 0.9.2 (Akalin et al. 2012) in R v3.0.3.  Pairwise coefficients by Pearson’s correlation scores were calculated based on the percent methylation profiles across all pairs of samples to create a matrix. Hierarchical clustering was performed using 1-Pearson’s correlation distance of the six methylation profiles. 


Differentially Methylated Loci 
In order to examine lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns we compared methylation differences between the two lineages (Lineages 1 and 3). Differential methylation at each loci was determined using Fisher’s exact test in methylKit. A CpG loci was determined to be different between lineages when the difference of methylation was more than 25% and p-value <0.01. 
To characterize DNA methylation patterns that changed during development we performed three pairwise comparisons between developmental stages (sperm and 72 hpf larvae, sperm and 120 hpf larvae, and 72 hpf and 120 hpf larvae). Differences through development were defined using Fisher’s exact test in methylKit. Differentially methylated loci were identified as any CpG where the difference of methylation was greater than 25% and p-value <0.01 for any comparison.
All loci determined to be different across lineages and during development were characterized with respect to overlapping genomic features (intron, exon, promoter region, transposable element) using Bedtools (i.e., intersectBed) (Quinlan and Hall, 2010).  Genomic features were developed and reported elsewhere (Gavery and Roberts 2013). Putative promoters were defined as 1kb regions upstream from transcription start sites.  Transposable elements were identified using RepeatMasker, a program that screens and annotates interspersed repeats (Smit et al., 1996-2010)[b][c]. Specifically, RepeatMasker (v3.3.0), with the NCBI/RMBLAST search engine, was used to identify putative transposable elements based on protein similarities to a Protein Database (see http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatProteinMask.html). At the time of analysis the Protein Database contained 5411 predicted proteins. RepeatMasker also uses Tandem Repeat Finder (Benson, 1999) to identify tandem repeats. A total of 119786 features are included in this transposable element genome feature file including 61319 tandem repeat regions and 58467 regions identified based on sequence similarity. This genome feature track along with intron, exon, and promoter region feature track are all available via the IPython notebook that provides code and data used in this manuscript (REFERENCE)[d]> A Chi-squared test was performed to determine if the distribution of differentially methylated loci among genomic regions (intron, exon, promoter region, transposable elements) was significantly different than the distribution of all CpGs in the oyster genome (p-value <0.05 was considered significant).




Results
Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Bisulfite treated DNA sequence reads are available (NCBI Sequence Read Archive: [e][f][g][h][i]BioProject PRJNA213124, Study Accession Number[j][k][l][m][n] SRP028178). Sodium bisulfite conversion efficiency was estimated to be 99.9% based on analysis of lambda phage DNA. The number cytosines where we have sequence information ranged from 2.6x107 to 5.3x107 across libraries. Using a 3x coverage threshold, a majority of cytosines (75-78%) were determined to be unmethylated (methylation ratio = 0), with 15-18% of the CpG dinucleotides methylated (methylation ratio  0.5) (data not shown[o][p]).


Genome-wide DNA Methylation Comparison
Sample correlation and clustering was performed to assess relationships on a genome-wide scale. A total of 40,654 common loci were present among all six samples and thus analyzed. Sperm and respective progeny exhibited high sample correlations with a pair-wise Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) of  0.84 for both lineages. These relationships are also evident in hierarchical clustering (Figure 1). Both male gamete samples were more similar in their methylation profiles to respective 120 hpf larvae.

Lineage-specific and Developmental Differences
A total of 189 lineage-specific differentially methylated loci (DMLs) were identified. Of these 102 were found to overlap with a defined genomic regions (exon, intron, promoter region, transposable element) (Figure 2). A majority of differentially methylated CpG loci among oyster lineages were in introns. However, when taken into account the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the oyster genome as a comparison, a high proportion of differentially methylated loci were found among transposable elements. The observed distribution of lineage-specific differentially methylated loci among transposable elements (2= 18.84, df= 1, p < 0.0001) is significantly different than the distribution of all CpGs in the oyster genome. 
Differences among oyster developmental stages were also identified revealing a total of 160 differentially methylated CpG loci. Of these loci, 99 overlapped with defined genomic regions genomic regions (Figure 2). Similarly, when compared to the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, the distribution of differentially methylated loci during oyster development was greater among transposable elements. The observed distribution of differentially methylated loci during development among transposable elements (2= 9.76, df= 1, p < 0.0018) was significantly different than the distribution of all CpGs in the oyster genome.

Discussion
This study represents the first single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes for both oyster sperm and larval samples from multiple crosses. This research not only provides new information on DNA methylation patterns during oyster development, but also examines the degree of inheritance and methylation changes during early development. Interestingly, our research indicates that different epigenetic patterns may differ among oyster families. 
Methylation levels in oyster sperm and larvae samples ranged from 15-18% with interspersed regions of both methylated and unmethylated DNA in both male gamete and larval samples. This proportion of CpG methylation falls within the range of that previously reported for oyster male gonad tissue (Olson and Roberts, 2014a) and oyster gill tissue (Gavery and Roberts, 2013). Overall methylation levels are also comparable to those reported among multiple developmental stages of the Pearl oyster Pinctada fucata (Li et al. 2014). These findings indicate that overall genome methylation in C. gigas is at an intermediate level and suggests that DNA methylation levels do not significantly vary between multiple cell types and life history stages. This is similar to what has been described in global 5-methylcytosine content during different stages of Ciona intestinalis development (Suzuki et al. 2013). However, it contrasts with research on mammals and vertebrates which exhibit the presence of tissue and developmental stage specific methylation profiles, as that seen in zebrafish (McGaughey et al. 2014). 
Genome-wide comparisons indicated oyster families are more similar in their DNA methylation patterns, as opposed to distinct developmental stages. These findings suggest that DNA methylation patterns are inherited from parents to their progeny, as methylation profiles were specific to oyster lineages. If epigenetic marks are indeed heritable, this mechanism has significant implications for selection. It has been proposed that epigenetic variation may compensate for a decrease in genetic variation in species such as sparrows (Shrey et al. 2012). While not performed in the current study, it is critical going forward to assess relationships between genetic and epigenetic variation. everal studies have done this in vertebrate and plant populations (Liu et al. 2012; Herrera and Bazaga 2010). Limited studies have focused on invertebrates, though Jiang et al. (2013) investigated the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations in two groups of C. gigas, a base population and third generation mass selection population. This study demonstrated genetic differentiation between the oyster mass selection populations, but did not find overall epigenetic variation (Jiang et al. 2013). Despite this, a significant correlation was observed between genetic and epigenetic profiles, with few individuals having similar genetic but distinct epigenetic profiles (Jiang et al. 2013). Regardless if epigenetic variation is independent of genotype, mechanisms involved in epigenetic inheritance are not fully understood.
The genome-wide methylation patterns along with the use of a common oocytes for crosses suggests DNA methylation patterns are paternally inherited. These results are similar to what has been seen in zebrafish where embryos inherit the methylation profile of sperm rather than oocyte (Jiang et al. 2013, Potok et al. 2013). Interestingly, recent research on the Pearl oyster found DNA methylation inheritance is mainly influenced by oocytes, rather than sperm (Li et al. 2014). These differences may be attributed to different analysis timepoints, as Li et al. (2014) primarily examined earlier developmental stages of the oyster. It is also possible that DNA methylation patterns of early larvae are influenced by oocytes, while embryos attain methylation patterns similar to the sperm during later developmental stages.
Upon identifying specific loci that were differentially methylated across lineages we found them to be spread throughout the genome. When directly compared to the location of CpG sites across the genome, we found there was a higher relative proportion of differentially methylated loci among transposable elements. We propose the reason we observe a relatively higher presence of lineage-specific differentially methylated loci in transposable elements is result of random phenomena that introduces epigenetic variation throughout the genome, where in many instances these epialles are detrimental. For instance, many differentially methylated loci that occur in gene bodies could be lethal, or have a negative impact as they would alter gene expression activity. It should be noted that it is still unclear what the role of DNA methylation is in regulating genome activity in C. gigas. However it has been suggested elevated methylation decreases spurious transcription of housekeeping genes and limited methylation in inducible genes facilitates multiple transcriptional opportunities (Roberts and Gavery, 2012). In other words, DNA methylation patterns in gene bodies have evolved over time based on gene function to best the needs of an organism that lives in a highly variable environment, and random changes in these patterns could be detrimental.  Further, we suggest random variations that occur in transposable elements have a relatively higher chance of persisting. Transposable elements are mobile DNA sequences that are generally considered to be methylated in many species to silence activity (Yoder et al. 1997; Liu and Schmid 1993).  Limited information is available about the methylation status of transposable elements in invertebrate species, and what is available suggests transposons are generally unmethylated and contain similar levels of methylation to neighboring DNA (Suzuki and Bird, 2008). This is in agreement with our previous research examining DNA methylation in oyster male gamete tissue, in which transposable elements contained limited methylation (Olson and Roberts, 2014). Assuming transposable element activity is less critical to survival than gene activity, our hypothesis is that when differentially methylated loci occurs in a transposable element it is less likely to have a negative consequence. It is also possible that if the differentially methylated loci resulted in increased transposable element mobility, advantageous genetic variation could result. This explanation is based on the idea that variation is introduced in a random fashion, something we do not have any evidence for though could be related to methyltransferase activity.
Differentially methylated loci during oyster developmental stages were also identified. A significant proportion of differentially methylated loci during oyster development were also found within transposable elements, relative to the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the oyster genome. Interestingly, we did not observe a high proportion of differentially methylated loci among promoter regions, as would be expected if promoter methylation was regulating gene expression to play a role in oyster development. Recent research has found that DNA methylation of promoter regions specifically controls expression of Hox genes during oyster development, in which increased methylation in promoter regions corresponds to decreased gene expression (Riviere et al. 2013). This was further supported by identifying considerable stage-specific differences in total methylation levels during oyster early development, indicating that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in oyster embryogenesis (Riviere et al. 2013). While our study did not examine gene expression levels, we previously found variation in expression levels depending on the amount of promoter region methylation (Olson and Roberts, 2014a). Surprisingly we did not observe any dramatic differences in overall methylation levels during oyster development, nor differential methylation of promoter regions. This is likely due to the different analysis time points as Riviere et al. (2013) examined the first 24 hours post-fertilization, and our first larval sample was taken at 72 hpf. It is also possible that only a subset of genes are transcriptionally controlled via DNA methylation and our global approach masked the ability to see differences[q][r] (Gavery and Roberts, 2014). 
In conclusion, this research suggests epigenetic inheritance as DNA methylation patterns were similar between males and their offspring and different between oyster lineages. Interestingly, we found the presence of lineage-specific methylation patterns, and a high relative proportion of these differentially methylated loci between lineages were present among transposable elements. Future research should focus more on if epigenetic variation is inherited independent of genetic variation and explore the possible relationship of DNA methylation and transposable element activity.

changes in methylation among transposable elements being less lethal than a change in methylation among genes.


and seeing if these patterns were heritable between parents and their offspring


A Chi-squared test was performed to determine if the distribution of all CpGs in the oyster genome is significantly different than what would be expected from a random distribution of differentially methylated loci among genomic regions (intron, exon, promoter region, transposable element).




The proportion of transposable elements among differentially methylated loci (15.68% average) was almost three times higher relative to CpGs located in transposable elements (5.87%). 




A high proportion of Helitron transposons were observed among lineage-specific differentially methylated loci, compared to the distribution of transposable elements differing during development (see http://tiny.cc/5r9gnx). An increase in the number of methylated DMLs located among transposable elements was found during the early larval stage (72 hpf). Specifically, the number of methylated DMLs located among transposable elements were 38 loci among sperm, 58 loci among 72 hpf larvae, and 23 loci among 120 hpf larvae. 
Specifically, recent research has examined the role of DNA methylation in developmental activity of the Pacific oyster. 




 individual variability of these epigenetic marks


Riviere et al. (2013) first observed developmental alterations in C. gigas after the addition of 5-aza-cytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Similarly, in investigating genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in developmental stages of the honey bee Apis mellifera, research found significant differences in the level of methylation between sample types (Drewell et al. 2014).
