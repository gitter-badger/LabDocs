Picture of class. 

Amazingly, a majority of this work was completed during a week long module at Friday Harbor Laboratories. The entire class used open notebook, courtesey of Open Notebook Science so  everyone can go in and see what everyone was doing.  The data and code are also available in a GitHub repository where one can both explore and reproduce the results.  Speaking of results, waht did we find?
