Post-doctoral position: The impact of ocean acidification on bivalve DNA methylation. 

We are currently seeking a post-doctoral scientist to study the influence of ocean acidification on DNA methylation pattern in Geoduck (Panopea generosa). The specific research objectives of the project are to characterize changes in allele frequencies under ocean acidification and temperature stress at single nucleotide polymorphisms throughout the genome, and determine the change in frequency of methylation states under ocean acidification and temperature stress throughout the epigenome.  will provide essential information on how marine invertebrate populations can respond to, and persist in, an acidifying ocean. Candidates should have a strong background in genetics and epigenetics with a familiarity of shellfish aquaculture. The position is funded for 12-months with a possibility of an extension up to 24-months.  If
